Exploring the performance of SGEMM in OpenCL on NVIDIA GPUs
=============

merge from https://github.com/CNugteren/myGEMM . Doc is https://cnugteren.github.io/tutorial/pages/page1.html

Usage
=============

*	Compile the code:

		make build

	Compiles the benchmarking infrastructure and the myGEMM kernels. Make sure there is a "bin" and "obj" directory available. Note that you might have to edit the Makefile to set the proper locations of the CUDA and OpenCL installations on your system.

*	Run the code:

		make run

	This runs the code for matrices ranging from MINSIZE to MAXSIZE (defined in src/common.h). It will run cuBLAS, clBlas, and the CUDA and OpenCL versions of the myGEMM kernels. The particular kernel to be executed is defined using the KERNEL keyword in src/settings.h. This file also contains other settings you might want to modify for your particular GPU.

*	Inspect the code:

		make inspect

	This generates all kinds of assembly-like versions of the CUDA kernels in the "bin" subdirectory. It also prints out statistics of the kernels such as the register usage.
